  """Compute hydrodynamic pressure on (ccc) that balances buoyancy, given œÅ.

  For an equilibrium situation where the fluid is at rest, the
  anelastic equation for w (vertical velocity) reduces to dp/dz = b.

  For computational reasons, it is advantageous to initialize the
  pressure such that it is in balance with the buoyancy.  This helps
  to preserve equilibrium, and also prevent the formation of gravity
  waves.

  If b can be calculated, then the exact discrete solution to
  dp/dz = b can be computed for p.
