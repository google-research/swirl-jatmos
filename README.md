# Swirl-Jatmos: JAX Atmospheric Simulation
*This is not an officially supported Google product.*

Swirl-Jatmos is a tool for performing 3D atmospheric large-eddy simulations in a
distributed setting on accelerators such as Google's Tensor Processing Units
(TPUs) and GPUs. Jatmos solves the anelastic Navier-Stokes equations on a
staggered, Arakawa C-grid, with physics modules supporting equilibrium
thermodynamics and one-moment microphysics.
